# robot_learning
A collection for algorithms for learning mobile robot control using reinforcement learning and imitation learning

Any differential drive mobile robot platform is compatible. For quick experimentation, it is best to use my [two wheel differential drive package](https://github.com/sarath-menon/robot_learning). After package installation ,run
```python
rosrun robot_learning policy_gradient_mobile_robot_nav.py
```
