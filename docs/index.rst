Some insights in reinforcement learning for mobile robots
#########################

Introduction
============

RL can incredibly difficult to set up even in simulation and needless to say, even more so on real
hardware. This is a curated lost of reinforcement learning experiments in mobile robotics tested first
in a gazebo based simulation environment that I developed myself and then verified on a commercially
available mobile robot platform. I have also created a curated list of interesting experiments regarding
RL in mobile robots which will surely be beneficial to the reader for reference.

An Example
============
